The issue is often related to the order of operations in `calc()`. Make sure percentages are calculated correctly.  If you are subtracting a percentage from a fixed value, ensure you use the correct unit.  For example, instead of `width: calc(100% - 20px);` which might cause problems, consider using `width: calc(100% - 20%);` or ensure the pixel value is converted to a percentage beforehand.  It's often helpful to break complex calculations into simpler ones for easier debugging.
